This folder includes the code and data for the supplementary experiment presented in the manuscript -

Marianna E. Hayiou-Thomas, and Lisa. M. Henderson at the Department of Psychology, University of York.

1. There are two scripts:
- Simulation - change ratio between probable and improbable trials: includes a simulation where the ratio between probable and improbable is manipulated to determine its impact on
											  the test-retest reliability

- Simulation - increase trials but maintain ratio between probable and improbable: includes a simulation where the number of trials is increased whilst maintaining the ratio
													     between probable and improbable trials constant to determine its impact on the test-retest reliability

2. In the plots folder you will find the plots generated by the simulation scripts
