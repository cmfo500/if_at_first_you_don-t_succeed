This folder includes the code and data for the second experiment presented in the manuscript -
Reliability of the Serial Reaction Time task: If at first you don't succeed, try try try again by CÃ¡tia M. Oliveira
Marianna E. Hayiou-Thomas, and Lisa. M. Henderson at Department of Psychology, University of York.

1. There are three scripts:
- Modelling: includes all models presented in the manuscript
- Test-retest reliability: examines test-retest reliability of the SRT task and individual differences
- Split-half reliability: examines split-half reliability of the SRT task

2. The Study2_data_all_variables.csv includes all data required to run the scripts with the exception of the Psychomotor Vigilance task data which is included
in the "PVT_results.csv" dataset. The latter dataset only includes Participant number and response times across trials.

The Study2_data_all_variables.csv dataset includes the following variables:

-- Experimental tasks
Procedural learning task

Epoch: Number of the epoch 1-5 (each epoch comprises 200 trials);
Trial_number: Trial number 1-1000;
Position: There were four positions of the stimuli on screen ZXNM from left to right on the keyboard;
Probability: Indicates the type of trial (1: Improbable, 2: Probable);
Response: Indicates the key on the keyboard pressed by the participant;
Accuracy: Indicates whether participants made the correct response (0 - incorrect, 1 - correct);
RT: Time elapsed between stimulus presentation and motor response;
Session: Indicates whether testing occurred in the first, second or third session;

Explicit awareness variables

Enjoyment: Rating of the levels of enjoyment (1-10) in the SRT task;
Explicit_Awareness: Response to whether participants had noticed a pattern in the SRT task (0 - yes, 1 - no, 2 - unsure);
Triplet_Match - Total number of triplets in common between the sequence generated by the participant and the underlying sequence in the SRT task;
Diff_triplets - Total number of distinct triplets in common between the sequence generated by the participant and the underlying sequence in the SRT task;
Longest - Longest sequence generated by the participant in common with the underlying sequence in the SRT task;
Distance - Levenshtein distance between sequences learnt at time 1 and 2;
Even_Odd - Signals whether the trial is even or odd - useful for split-half reliability analyses;

-- Participant Characteristics

Include Age, Language (Monolingual, Bilingual, etc), Nationality, Handedness, Language and literacy variables (Vocabulary, Nonword_reading, Word_reading, Spelling, Recalling, Nonword_repetition, Matrix_Reasoning) and
Attention skills on the PVT (PVT_reciprocal, PVT_lapses)


3. There is also a result section where we included the output from the mixed modelling as these models take a fairly long time to run.
For the influential cases, since we had to resort to the High performance computing at York, we also included the output from those analyses.
We have run the same models in Julia and these ran a lot quicker, so we can provide that code if necessary.
